		<article>Decodaquote puzzles are encoded messages, fun and educational for the whole family. They are great for children and teenagers and they keep us all thinking.
		Decodaquote fits in a coat pocket or purse, and is designed to fill an idle moment while commuting or waiting in line. Tear apart the thick ones and take what you need to keep yourself entertained for the day. Keep a tablet near your table for a quick pick-up.
		A frequent mental snack on Decodaquote feeds your brain with good humor, lofty thoughts and warm fuzzies.</article>

		<article id="aboutUsArticle">When the cryptogram in my local newspaper disappeared I began encoding snippets for my own pleasure.
		</br>
		Several weeks later I had a chance encounter with the editor and asked if he'd consider the work of a local cryptographer. He hired me on the contingency that I wouldn't get bored and quit in three months. I promised him I wouldn't; my first cryptogram debuted in 1990.

		Decodaquote currently appears in the Calgary Herald and Kitsap Sun.
 
		After a few years, I began to produce puzzle tablets. I produce both theme tablets of 100 puzzles and tablets with a year's worth of challenges (366).  My inventory continues to grow, and selections are available through the "Order tablets" catalogue.
